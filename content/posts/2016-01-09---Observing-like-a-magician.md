## The Growth Mindset 

Few years ago, I realized in order to really grow, I need to stop looking at interesting things with the star-eyed fascination.

Rather, to view them as an illusionist attending a show of a fellow illusionist. The illusionist who attends the show of other illusionist comes with a clear objective in his mind, to learn or decipher the tricks of his fellow illusionist. Unlike the audience, the illusionist doesn't really buy into the charm, the pledge, the turn or the prestige. 

The question on the determined illusonist mind is **How was the fellow illusionist able to do the magic trick?**

Looking at the world and creations of fellow humans in the same way has made me more inquisitive.

## Difference in Level

But of course, there could be a huge difference in the capabilities of two people. But according the growth mindset, the difference in abilities of two humans is not set in stone and with sufficient hard work, everyone would be able to cross the chasm of abilities. 

And this is not an original thought. 

I believe Steve Jobs said it best.

		<p> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>
  
  <p> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.</p>

So, yeah. 

Look into the world as a magician, trying to understand the tricks. 

You will be surprised as to what you discover.
