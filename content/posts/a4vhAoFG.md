On July 17th, 2036, an important event took place in the course human history. 

Tony Zu got dumped by his long term girlfriend. 

Though this incident itself was not of any significance, except to Tony maybe, it inadvertently set the wheels in motion for a major catestophe. But first in order to understand the catastrophe, lets go back to origin of the event with the critical patch. 


## The critical patch

The outrage began at 4 in the morning. A post detailing list of several vulnerabities of the `singularity kernal`[^1] ranging from moderately severe to critical was posted to an infosec blog. Nearly every `BMI`[^2], whether it was sold commercial, created by hobbyist or used in an academic setting, had some portion of the code dependent on the `singularity kernal`. And now everything was exposed on the internet, by an infosec blogger.

The entire staff belonging to Advanced Development at Memento, the company which maintained the `singularity kernal`, were awake. The `BMI` which they used was `N0-3L`, the most advanced and invite-only protype, had initiated a gentle wake-from-dream routine, then proceeded to guide the employees to a set of breathing exercises. Once, it verified that the employees physical status was fit to be given status reports, it provided them with the news of why it had to wake them up at such important time. 

The employees knew that Noel would never wake them up from sleep, unless it was really critical. Noel, the AI agent inside their brain, had 
a specific function i.e for the welfare of the human host, but they had also given Noel access to wake them up, in case of emergencies, natural calamities or terrorist attacks or as in this case, a work related emergency. 

Noel briefed them about the post, the vulnerabilities, the attacks and informed them that Mark, the CEO would be addressing via the `PsyConf`[^3]. As if Noel waking them up was not enough, Mark addressing them, suddenly made the sense of urgency all too real. 

When the conference started, Mark took the speaker deck and put everyone on mute. 

"Hello Folks. As I am sure, Noel as explained you the gravity of the situation, I am here to you tell you some additional details." Mark stopped as if trying to decide where to start from. 

"3 hours earlier, I recieved a video from Vladimir, our Head of Security. In it were demands that, unless we give them, whoever they are, 1 Million `C12s`[^4], 388 vulnerabilities of the `singularities kernal` will be published on the internet. My initial thoughts were that they were bluffing, but it seems that they are not. They have published 40 vulnerabilies and the attacks eploiting these have already started. Our off-shore team have been dealing with the attacks and they will be at it for next couple of hours, at least. In the mean time, I would like to specify the two objectives today. First one, push patches to fix the vulnerabilities ASAP and second, identify future vulnerabilitie. Meanwhite, I am with the FBI trying to track this son of a bitch and give him the beating he fucking deserves. On the day of our 10th Anniversery. Jesus. Any Questions."

Mark, signalled Noel to start the QnA Mode. 

"Yeah, Peter"

Peter still not completely over his sleep spoke sheepishly. "What about the money? Are we going to give them the money."

"What? No. Hell. NO". 

"But we do have money, right. Why don't we just give .."

"We are not going to be held hostage by, a probably an underage kid living with his mom."

"Oh. That's bad."

"Any other relevant questions ?" Mark asked impatiently. 

"Who do you think it is ?" came a question. 

"No Idea."

"Do you think it is the `EOS`[^5]?" added another.

"No. Cannot rule anything out. But I don't think so."

"Last year, on 9th anniversary, they made your flying balloon and set it on fire." 

"Yeah. And the media had a field raining shit on me for a month for that too but EOS usually resorts to small-scale petty things." Mark said in a reassuring tone. 

"Okay. Has Zu returned ?" asked another. 

"That's an excellent question, the only thing good that has happened to me today, is I got hold off Zu and I believe he is present in the conference. Are you there, Tony?"

"Hmmm." replied Tony in his usual indifferent voice. 

"Okay. Great. I am sorry to have disturbed you on your 40-days silent retreat, but as you can see, you are the one who wrote the kernal, so indirectly you are responsible for the bugs."

"Fuck you, Mark ! Okay. Everybody. I have identified 130 possible vulnerabilities going through logs and finding anomalies, have written patch for 12 and have classified the vulnerabilities on the basis urgency. There are plenty for everyone. Divide yourself in three teams. One, write patches of identified ones, two, review patch and release and three, identify potential vulnerabilities from logs, previous user reports, or any anomaly behavior. Any questions ?"

"Yes" Peter quipped.

"Anyone else?" Tony spoke with impatience. "Okay Peter shoot."

"How are you holding up?"

"I am doing fine, Peter. Thanks for your concern. Now get to work, quickly." ordered Tony.

"Yes. Everyone. Thanks for joining on a short notice." Mark said while disconnecting the call.

For everyone else, who were trying to piece together as to what happened to Tony, Noel delivered the message.

## Phoenix

Tony asked to his Noel to bring up the list of inventors killed by their own inventions. He could come up with only one, Guilliotine. When he had first heard of this, he found it funny and then sad. He would frequently imagine what would Gulliotine must be feeling in his last moments. Now, he could say he can. 

He had created the Memento Mori neural application to help people selectively dissociate bad/traumatic memories. It had two level filter, one temporary dissociation and then permanent dissaociation. The tech-media when it got its hand on the tool, went wild with speculation. It was extremely successful in treating PTSD patients, rape victims, child abuse etc. But some columnist wrote an article titled *How I hacked my brain to forget my abusive ex-boyfriend and finally move on with life.* 

She was a widely read columnist who had a large following on her social media accounts. This triggered a movement across the world, to DIY hack their own memories. Tony was not entirely up for this consumer facing application but Mark his best-friend and co-founder thought it was foolish to stand between someone offering money. The publisher of the article championed the use of Memento as an effective tool to balance the burden caused by the essence of being human. She wrote posts, did podcasts, appeared on leading news TV all without ever being in actual touch with the company. 

Although, Mark thought it was kind of crazy about all the attention they were getting and felt immensly lucky for having something like this occured to Memento, he knew the FDA was never going to actually approve, self-monitored memory removal procedure. And on the top of that, it also had a criminal intent. People could do horrible things and then just wipe their memories about and stay guilt free. 

The memory wiping technology in the hands of common people could wreck havoc as well as bring a lot of positive change. Mark thought. It might actually make a world better place to live. 

When unoffical-Memento spokesperson went on to television, Mark and Tony sat together to watch the telecast. In the mid of her interview, the interview posed the question.

"If all the effects you say, this piece of technology has, is true then why isn't the company marketing it. What is stopping them?"

"Well, I can think of several reasons. One being FDA, this evil tyrant anti-woman organisation which doesn't know how to have fun. I mean LSD was banned till 10 years ago until we rallied, `Allies of Social Justice`[^5] took the issue and started rallying behind it. The second being, the company doesn't understand what it has in its hand. They have discovered fire and they are using it keep their hands warm in winter."

At this moment, Mark turned to Tony.

"We should probably double down on this."

Tony, like Mark, had weighed the pros and cons of Memento in the hands of public. At that moment, Memento was used in hospital and had over 2 Million users around the world who were provided as a treatment. Getting the data from potentially a billion pbeople across the world, might reveal some interesting insights of brain. But he still doubted if FDA was going to approve it. 

"What about FDA? We are basically pivoting to an entirely different market here. We need help."

"About the FDA, I think I can get someone onboard, who can help us deal with that and a lot more. In fact, I have got her number here."

"Who?" Tony asked. 

"This crazy woman" Mark replied pointing a finger towards the screen.

"Hmm. Okay." Tony said. "Time to get Ms. Phoenix Jacobs on board."


## Querencia

Bringing Phoenix onto the team, was a good decision. When Mark had called her if she would like to join Memento as the official spokesperson and help them develop the product more suitable for mass wide adoption, her reply was *I thought you would never call*.

Before Phoenix she joined the team, she had a made a list of odd demands that were to be met.  

About the FDA, Phoenix started a three step campaign. First, she went around the world evalengizing Memento. She went to groups, gave lectures or tours. She hosted several events for the DIY hackers all around the globe. Second, she put the status of Memento as a boring medical technology to the liberator of women and other members of AOS. She had been member of the AOS since childhood. Her single-mother was one of the earliest staunch AOS member right from its inception. Phoenix knew clearly . 

Finding Querencia.
