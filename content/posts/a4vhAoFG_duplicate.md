On July 17th, 2036, an important event took place in the course human history. 

Tony Zu got dumped by his long term girlfriend. 

Though this incident itself was not of any significance, except to Tony maybe, it inadvertently set the wheels in motion for a major catestophe. But first in order to understand the catastrophe, lets go back to origin of the event with the critical patch. 


## The critical patch

The outrage began at 4 in the morning. A post detailing list of several vulnerabities of the `singularity kernal`[^1] ranging from moderately severe to critical was posted to an infosec blog. Nearly every `BMI`[^2], whether it was sold commercial, created by hobbyist or used in an academic setting, had some portion of the code dependent on the `singularity kernal`. And now everything was exposed on the internet, by an infosec blogger.

The entire staff belonging to Advanced Development at Memento, the company which maintained the `singularity kernal`, were awake. The `BMI` which they used was `N0-3L`, the most advanced and invite-only protype, had initiated a gentle wake-from-dream routine, then proceeded to guide the employees to a set of breathing exercises. Once, it verified that the employees physical status was fit to be given status reports, it provided them with the news of why it had to wake them up at such important time. 

The employees knew that Noel would never wake them up from sleep, unless it was really critical. Noel, the AI agent inside their brain, had 
a specific function i.e for the welfare of the human host, but they had also given Noel access to wake them up, in case of emergencies, natural calamities or terrorist attacks or as in this case, a work related emergency. 

Noel briefed them about the post, the vulnerabilities, the attacks and informed them that Mark, the CEO would be addressing via the `PsyConf`[^3]. As if Noel waking them up was not enough, Mark addressing them, suddenly made the sense of urgency all too real. 

When the conference started, Mark took the speaker deck and put everyone on mute. 

"Hello Folks. As I am sure, Noel as explained you the gravity of the situation, I am here to you tell you some additional details." Mark stopped as if trying to decide where to start from. 

"3 hours earlier, I recieved a video from Vladimir, our Head of Security. In it were demands that, unless we give them, whoever they are, 1 Million `C12s`[^4], 388 vulnerabilities of the `singularities kernal` will be published on the internet. My initial thoughts were that they were bluffing, but it seems that they are not. They have published 40 vulnerabilies and the attacks eploiting these have already started. Our off-shore team have been dealing with the attacks and they will be at it for next couple of hours, at least. In the mean time, I would like to specify the two objectives today. First one, push patches to fix the vulnerabilities ASAP and second, identify future vulnerabilitie. Meanwhite, I am with the FBI trying to track this son of a bitch and give him the beating he fucking deserves. On the day of our 10th Anniversery. Jesus. Any Questions."

Mark, signalled Noel to start the QnA Mode. 

"Yeah, Peter"

Peter still not completely over his sleep spoke sheepishly. "What about the money? Are we going to give them the money."

"What? No. Hell. NO". 

"But we do have money, right. Why don't we just give .."

"We are not going to be held hostage by, a probably an underage kid living with his mom."

"Oh. That's bad."

"Any other relevant questions ?" Mark asked impatiently. 

"Who do you think it is ?" came a question. 

"No Idea."

"Do you think it is the `EOS`[^5]?" added another.

"No. Cannot rule anything out. But I don't think so."

"Last year, on 9th anniversary, they made your flying balloon and set it on fire." 

"Yeah. And the media had a field raining shit on me for a month for that too but EOS usually resorts to small-scale petty things." Mark said in a reassuring tone. 

"Okay. Has Zu returned ?" asked another. 

"That's an excellent question, the only thing good that has happened to me today, is I got hold off Zu and I believe he is present in the conference. Are you there, Tony?"

"Hmmm." replied Tony in his usual indifferent voice. 

"Okay. Great. I am sorry to have disturbed you on your 40-days silent retreat, but as you can see, you are the one who wrote the kernal, so indirectly you are responsible for the bugs."

"Fuck you, Mark ! Okay. Everybody. I have identified 130 possible vulnerabilities going through logs and finding anomalies, have written patch for 12 and have classified the vulnerabilities on the basis urgency. There are plenty for everyone. Divide yourself in three teams. One, write patches of identified ones, two, review patch and release and three, identify potential vulnerabilities from logs, previous user reports, or any anomaly behavior. Any questions ?"

"Yes" Peter quipped.

"Anyone else?" Tony spoke with impatience. "Okay Peter shoot."

"How are you holding up?"

"I am doing fine, Peter. Thanks for your concern. Now get to work, quickly." ordered Tony.

"Yes. Everyone. Thanks for joining on a short notice." Mark said while disconnecting the call.

For everyone else, who were trying to piece together as to what happened to Tony, Noel delivered the message.

## Querencia

Tony asked to his Noel to bring up the list of inventors killed by their own inventions. He could come up with only one, Guilliotine. When he had first heard of this, he found it funny and then sad. He would frequently imagine what would Gulliotine must be feeling in his last moments. Now, he could say he can. 

He had created the Memento Mori neural application to help people selectively dissociate bad/traumatic memories. It had two level filter, one temporary dissociation and then permanent dissaociation. The tech-media when it got its hand on the tool, went wild with speculation. It was extremely successful in treating PTSD patients, rape victims, child abuse etc. But some columnist wrote an article title *how she hacked her brain to forget her abusive ex-boyfriend and finally move on with life.*

She was a widely read columnist who had a large following. This triggered a movement across the world, to DIY their own memories. Tony was not entirely up for this consumer facing application but Mark his best-friend and co-founder thought it was foolish to stand between someone offering money. It took, time

Mark nudged him. 

“You are fucking billionaire, you can get whatever you want.” 

There were a lot of things he couldn’t get, even if he want. Tony thought.

An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill takes the reader back to the year 1930. The year when a conflict between two worlds came to its term. The machines of the industrial world finally took over the handicrafts.

The typography of this industrial age was no longer handcrafted. Mass production and profit became more important. Quantity mattered more than the quality. The books and printed works in general lost a part of its humanity. The typefaces were not produced by craftsmen anymore. It was the machines printing and tying the books together now. The craftsmen had to let go of their craft and became a cog in the process. An extension of the industrial machine.

But the victory of the industrialism didn’t mean that the craftsmen were completely extinct. The two worlds continued to coexist independently. Each recognising the good in the other — the power of industrialism and the humanity of craftsmanship. This was the second transition that would strip typography of a part of its humanity. We have to go 500 years back in time to meet the first one.



A similar conflict emerged after the invention of the first printing press in Europe. Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type and used it to produce different compositions. His workshop could print up to 240 impressions per hour. Until then, the books were being copied by hand. All the books were handwritten and decorated with hand drawn ornaments and figures. A process of copying a book was long but each book, even a copy, was a work of art.

The first printed books were, at first, perceived as inferior to the handwritten ones. They were smaller and cheaper to produce. Movable type provided the printers with flexibility that allowed them to print books in languages other than Latin. Gill describes the transition to industrialism as something that people needed and wanted. Something similar happened after the first printed books emerged. People wanted books in a language they understood and they wanted books they could take with them. They were hungry for knowledge and printed books satisfied this hunger.

*The 42–Line Bible, printed by Gutenberg.*

But, through this transition, the book lost a large part of its humanity. The machine took over most of the process but craftsmanship was still a part of it. The typefaces were cut manually by the first punch cutters. The paper was made by hand. The illustrations and ornaments were still being hand drawn. These were the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.

## The digital age

The first transition took away a large part of humanity from written communication. Industrialisation, the second transition described by Eric Gill, took away most of what was left. But it’s the third transition that stripped it naked. Typefaces are faceless these days. They’re just fonts on our computers. Hardly anyone knows their stories. Hardly anyone cares. Flicking through thousands of typefaces and finding the “right one” is a matter of minutes.

> In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.
>
— Massimo Vignelli

Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, it’s about what feels right. What communicates the message best. Typography, in its essence, is about the message. “Typographical design should perform optically what the speaker creates through voice and gesture of his thoughts.”, as El Lissitzky, a famous Russian typographer, put it.

## Loss of humanity through transitions

Each transition took away a part of humanity from written language. Handwritten books being the most humane form and the digital typefaces being the least. Overuse of Helvetica is a good example. Messages are being told in a typeface just because it’s a safe option. It’s always there. Everyone knows it but yet, nobody knows it. Stop someone on the street and ask him what Helvetica is? Ask a designer the same question. Ask him where it came from, when, why and who designed it. Most of them will fail to answer these questions. Most of them used it in their precious projects but they still don’t spot it in the street.

Typefaces don’t look handmade these days. And that’s all right. They don’t have to. Industrialism took that away from them and we’re fine with it. We’ve traded that part of humanity for a process that produces more books that are easier to read. That can’t be bad. And it isn’t.

> Humane typography will often be comparatively rough and even uncouth; but while a certain uncouthness does not seriously matter in humane works, uncouthness has no excuse whatever in the productions of the machine.
>
> — Eric Gill

We’ve come close to “perfection” in the last five centuries. The letters are crisp and without rough edges. We print our compositions with high–precision printers on a high quality, machine made paper.

![type-through-time.jpg](/media/type-through-time.jpg)

*Type through 5 centuries.*

We lost a part of ourselves because of this chase after perfection. We forgot about the craftsmanship along the way. And the worst part is that we don’t care. The transition to the digital age made that clear. We choose typefaces like clueless zombies. There’s no meaning in our work. Type sizes, leading, margins… It’s all just a few clicks or lines of code. The message isn’t important anymore. There’s no more “why” behind the “what”.

## Chasing perfection

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. What typeface should we use and why? Does the typeface match the message and what we want to communicate with it? What will be the leading and why? Will there be more typefaces in our design? On what ground will they be combined? What makes our design unique and why? This is the part of humanity that is left in typography. It might be the last part. Are we really going to give it up?
