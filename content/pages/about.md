Hi there !

Thank you for stumbling upon this dark corner of the internet. 

I am Siddharth. Right now, I am heavily-occpied into building **Primer**, which is basically a new form of learning medium. To know more about Primer, you can check out the website [Primerlabs.io](https://www.primerlabs.io "Primer's Homepage"). 

I launched Primer Landing Page in Feb, 2019 and there has been a lot of changes and it hasn't been updated. 

I am bad with deadlines and superbad when I am the one giving it to myself, but it seems that Primer will be launched by the end of July 2019. **Finally** :)

Some screenshots for the Primer:

Apart from that, I am interested in understanding how the brain works. 

That's all Folks.
